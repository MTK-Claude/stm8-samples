This is a simple example of INDEPENDENT management of 3 stepper motors.
All motors have independent lines DIR and CLK and common line EN.
Communication with MCU realized through simple USB<->TTL converter.
Just connect lines Rx/Tx of converter to Tx/Rx of evaluation boart,
connect together lines GND and +3.3V.
Communication speed: 57600, proto: 8N1
Comminication with MCU don't need special soft: you can even run screen session
or some terminal client like _com_. Another wariant is a simple client - client-term.
MCU itself can print to terminal a short help about its protocol, just sent letter 'h'
to it.

!!! ALL "steps" suppose to be single pulses, you should convert them into real !!!
!!!         steps (dividing by microstepping) in your own soft                 !!!
